## 🔐 CRITICAL: DON'T FORGET

1. **Update canonical URL** if your site isn't "yoursite.com"

   - This is CRITICAL for rankings!

2. **Add Google verification code** (optional but recommended)
   - Get from GSC
   - Replace in: `<meta name="google-site-verification"...`

3. **Update social media links**
